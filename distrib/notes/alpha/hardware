.Pp
NetBSD/alpha \*V runs on most of the
.Tn DEC
Alpha PCI platforms, on all
of the TURBOChannel models, on the high end 8200 and 8400 systems,
and on the 4100 series.
.Pp
The SRM console is required.
This
console can be distinguished from the ARC console (which is used to
boot Windows NT) by the fact that it has a command line interface,
rather than a menu-driven interface. The SRM prompt is ``\*>\*>\*>''.
.Pp
Some platforms have both the SRM console and
the ARC console, and can switch between them, and other platforms have
only one type of console loaded at any one time.
If your system comes up with the ARC firmware, it may be possible
to switch it to SRM with a menu or
to download SRM from
.Lk ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/Digital/Alpha/firmware/index.html .
You may want to buy a firmware update CD from Compaq Computer Corporation.
.Pp
More information on supported platforms and devices can be found on the
alpha port web pages at
.Lk http://www.netbsd.org/ "" .
.Pp
A basic system will fit on a 200 MB disk (including swap) without too
much difficulty, but you will probably want at least 500 MB of disk
to have any level of comfort.
.Pp
Although
it is actually possible to boot and install NetBSD/alpha in only
16 MB of RAM, you will want to have at least 32 MB.

We support add-in devices on the PCI, ISA, EISA and TurboChannel buses.
Because NetBSD has an extremely machine-independent device driver
system, many device drivers are the same as used in other ports that
use the same bus. For example, the `de' network card driver is shared
by the i386 and Alpha ports. Some drivers on inspection appear as if
they will work on the alpha but have not been tested because that
hardware was not available to NetBSD testers; these are marked as
.Em untested
below. If you have one of these devices, and it does work,
please get in touch with
.Mt port-alpha-maintainer@netbsd.org
and let us know that it works. If it doesn't work, do the same thing and we
can probably fix it pretty easily.

Note that some devices, especially ISA-based devices, have to have
certain settings set properly for the install and GENERIC kernels to
detect them. (Once installed, you can always rebuild your own kernel
to detect them anywhere you wish, of course.) Here is a list of such
devices and the necessary settings:
