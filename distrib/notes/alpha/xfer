A large number of different media types can be used to hold the
binary distribution sets, but they must originally be obtained
from the
.Nx
project via a mechanism from the list below.
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
FTP
.It
Remote NFS partition
.It
CD-ROM
.El
.Pp
The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which installation medium you choose.
The steps for the various media are outlined below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width NFS\ Installation
.It Em NFS\ Installation
Place the NetBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading NetBSD.
This will probably require modifying the
.Pa /etc/exports
file on of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the closest router .
Finally, you need to know the numeric
IP address of the NetBSD machine itself. The install
program will ask you to provide this information to be able
to access the sets.
.Pp
Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can start the actual
installation process.
.It Em FTP\ Installation
Determine an FTP site from which
you can retrieve the NetBSD distribution when you're about
to install. You will need to know the IP address of your
nameserver or of your ftp site,
and, if it's not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading NetBSD,
you need to know the IP address of the router
closest to the NetBSD machine. Finally, you need to know
the numeric IP address of the NetBSD machine itself. The
install program will ask you to provide this information
to be able to access the sets via ftp.
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the actual
installation.
.It Upgrade
If you are upgrading NetBSD, you also have the option of installing
NetBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there. To do that, you must do the
following:
.Pp
Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
your current file system tree. Please note that the
.Pa /dev
on the floppy used for upgrades only knows about wd0, wd1, sd0,
sd1 and sd2. If you have more than two IDE drives or more than
three SCSI drives, you should take care not to place the sets
on the high numbered drives.
.Pp
At a bare minimum, you must upgrade the
.Sy base
and
.Sy kern
binary distribution, and so must put the
.Sy base
and
.Sy kern
sets somewhere in your file system. If you wish,
you can do the other sets, as well, but you should
.Em not
upgrade the
.Sy etc
distribution; it contains system
configuration files that you should review and update by hand.
.Pp
Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.
