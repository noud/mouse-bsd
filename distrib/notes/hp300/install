The miniroot's install program is very simple to use. It will guide
you through the entire process, and is well automated. Additional
improvements are planned for future releases.
.Pp
The miniroot's install program will:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Allow you to place disklabels on additional disks.
Note that partition sizes and offsets are expressed
in sectors. When you fill out the disklabel, you will
need to specify partition types and filesystem parameters.
If you're unsure what the these values should be, use the
following:
.Bd -ragged
fstype: 4.2BSD
fsize: 1024
bsize: 4096
cpg: 16
.Ed
If the partition will be a swap partition, use the following:
.Bd -ragged
fstype: swap
fsize: 0 (or blank)
bsize: 0 (or blank)
cpg: 0 (or blank)
.Ed
.Pp
You will also need to specify the number of partitions.
The number of partitions is determined by the `index' of
the last partition letter, where a == 1, b == 2, etc.
Therefore, if the last filled partition is partition `g',
there are 7 partitions. Any partitions with size of 0
may be removed from the list.
.Pp
If the disk is the boot disk, you _must_ offset the root
partition (`a') one cylinder, as the hp300 boot code
if large enough to spill past the label area. In this case,
the `c' partition must be fstype `boot'.
.Pp
Anything after a `#' is a comment.
.Pp
The following is an example disklabel partition map:
.Bd -literal
7 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
a:    30912      448    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    1 - 69)
b:   130816    31360      swap                        # (Cyl.   70 - 361)
c:  1296512        0      boot                        # (Cyl.    0 - 2893)
e:    81984   162176    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  362 - 544)
f:   102592   244160    4.2BSD     1024  4096    16   # (Cyl.  545 - 773)
g:   949760   346752    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  774 - 2893)
.Ed
.It
Create filesystems on target partitions.
.It
Allow you to set up your system's network configuration.
Remember to specify host names without the domain name
appended to the end. For example use `foo' instead of
`foo.bar.org'. If, during the process of configuring
the network interfaces, you make a mistake, you will
be able to re-configure that interface by simply selecting
it for configuration again.
.It
Mount target filesystems. You will be given the opportunity
to manually edit the resulting
.Pa /etc/fstab .
.It
Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.
.It
Copy configuration information gathered during the
installation process to your root filesystem.
.It
Make device nodes in your root filesystem.
.It
Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
.It
Install a new boot block.
.It
Check your filesystems for integrity.
.El
.Pp
First-time installation on a system through a method other than the
installation program is possible, but strongly discouraged.
