Currently, only installing the miniroot from the network is supported.
This may change in a future release.
.Pp
You will need information about your disk's geometry, based on 512-byte
sectors. You must have this information before proceeding. The
file `.../installation/misc/HP-IB.geometry' has geometry inforomation for
several HP-IB disks, but may be incomplete. Geometry may be calculated
from an HP-UX `/etc/disktab' entry, but note that HP-UX geometry is based
on 1024 byte sectors, while NetBSD's is based on 512 byte sectors.
.Pp
.Em A quick note about partitions:
Since the target disk will become the boot
disk for your new NetBSD/hp300 installation, you will need to treat the
`a' and `c' partitions in a special manner. Due to the size of the
NetBSD/hp300 boot program (it spills into the area after the disklabel),
it is necessary to offset the `a' partition one cylinder from the beginning
of the disk. Later, the `c' partition will be marked with the type
`FS_BOOT' and may not be used for a filesystem. (For those unfamiliar
with historic BSD partition conventions, the `c' partition is defined
as `the entire disk', or the `raw partition'.)
.Pp
.Em A quick note about disk numbers:
While in the SYS_INST program, you
may use different unit numbers for the disks than when the NetBSD
kernel is running. The unit number for a disk while in SYS_INST is
calculated with the following formula:
.Dl unit = (controller * 8) + slave
Controllers are numbered 0, 1, ... starting with the lowest select code.
SCSI controllers and HP-IB controllers are counted separately. Therefore,
if you had a system with an internal HP-IB interface at select code 7,
a fast HP-IB interface at select code 14, and a SCSI interface at select
code 16, unit numers might be something like the following:
.Bl -column -offset indent HP-IB\ at\ 14,\ slave\ 5 Unit (disk:\ rd13)
.It Sy Location Ta Sy Unit
.It HP-IB\ at\ 7,\ slave\ 2 Ta 2 Ta (disk:\ rd2)
.It HP-IB\ at\ 14,\ slave\ 5 Ta 13 Ta (disk:\ rd13)
.It SCSI\ at\ 16,\ slave\ 0 Ta 0 Ta (disk:\ sd0)

.Ss2 Miniroot installation via network
.(tag Em Note:
Booting sys_inst via the network
on early hp300 models
.Em is only
.Em possible if your bootrom
.Em is No rev. c Em or later.
When checking the
revision of your BOOTROM, use what it printed on the console during
the self-test, not what may be printed on a sticker on the chip itself.
.tag)
.Pp
In order to complete this process, you will need the following from the
.Pa \&.../installation/misc
directory of the distribution:
.(tag SYS_INST.gz
The standalone disklabel and miniroot
installation tool. This file must be un-gzipped before using.
.tag)
.Pp
And you will need
the following from the
.Pa \&.../installation/miniroot
directory of of the distribution:
.(tag miniroot.fs.gz
A miniroot filesystem image.
.tag)
.Pp
To boot SYS_INST via the network, you will need a system capable of handling
boot requests for an HP workstation. If you will use this method, see the
special note below.
.Pp
To boot SYS_INST from tape, you need only place SYS_INST on the tape as
the first file.
.
.
.(tag Em Loading\ SYS_INST\ via\ the\ network xxxxxxx
.Pp
If you wish to load the SYS_INST program via the network, you may need
the following from the `.../installation/misc' directory in addition to the
items listed above:
.(tag Pa rbootd.tgz
Source code for the rbootd program included with
NetBSD. It requires that the server has a
Berkeley Packet Filter (bpf). You will need to
compile this version of rbootd if your server
system does not have this utility already.
.tag)
.Pp
First of all, configure your rbootd to handle boot requests from the
client. NOTE: NetBSD's `rbootd' is slightly different from HP-UX's.
To configure NetBSD's `rbootd', create a file called `/etc/rbootd.conf'
and place in it an entry like the following:
.
.Dl 08:00:09:04:AA:33 SYS_INST # thunder-egg
.
The first column is the ethernet address of the client's network interface.
The second column is the program to send to the client, and anything after
the `#' is a comment. Once you have rbootd running, copy the SYS_INST
program to the /usr/mdec/rbootd directory on your server. If this
directory doesn't exist already, you will need to create it.
.Pp
For information on configuring rbootd under HP-UX, see the rbootd(1M)
manual page on your server system.
.Pp
Once `rbootd' is configured and running, you will be ready to continue.
.tag)
.
.
.Pp
Make sure that the miniroot filesystem image has been un-gzipped, and
that it resides in a filesystem what is exported to the client. See the
manual pages on your server system if you need more information about
exporting filesystems.
.Pp
You are now ready to SYS_INST. During the client's self-test cycle, press
the space bar a few times. Shortly, you should see a menu of possible boot
options appear. Select the option corresponding to SYS_INST. SYS_INST will
load and prompt you for a command.
.Pp
If this is a new NetBSD installation, you will need to place a disklabel
on the disk.
.Dl sys_inst\*> disklabel
.(tag Em Note:
It may be worth selecting the `zap' option initially to ensure that
the disklabel area is clear. This may be especially important if an
HP-UX boot block had been previously installed on the disk.
.tag)
.Pp
Select the `edit' option, and answer the questions about your disk.
There may be several questions which you may not be sure of the answers
to. Listed below are guidelines for SCSI and HP-IB disks:
.Pp
.Bl -column -offset indent -compact Track-to-track?xx xxxxx
.It Bad\ sectoring? Ta NO
.It Ecc? Ta NO
.It Interleave? Ta 1
.It Trackskew? Ta 0
.It Cylinderskew? Ta 0
.It Headswitch? Ta 0
.It Track-to-track? Ta 0
.It Drivedata\ 0-4? Ta 0\ (for\ all\ Drivedata\ values)
.El
.Pp
Next, you will be asked to fill out the partition map. You must provide
responses for all 8 partitions. Remember, you must allocate at least 6M
for the `b' partition, or else the miniroot will not fit. Set the size and
offset of any unused partition to 0. Note that sizes and offsets are
expressed in `n sectors', assuming 512 byte sectors. Care should be taken
to ensure that partitions begin and end on cylinder boundaries (i.e. size
and offset is an even multiple of the number of sectors per cylinder).
While this is not technically necessary, it is generally encouraged.
.Pp
.(tag Em Note:
When setting the partition type of the `b' partition, make sure to
specify it as an `ffs' partition so that the miniroot can be mounted (even
if this will be a swap partition). You will be given a chance to clean
this up later in the installation process.
.tag)
.Pp
Once you have edited the label, select the `show' option to verify that
it is correct. If so, select `write' and `done'. Otherwise, you may
re-edit the label.
.Pp
The next step is to copy the miniroot image onto the target disk.
.Dl sys_inst\*> miniroot
You will be prompted for the target disk and the source of the miniroot
filesytem image.
.Pp
Enter the filename of the miniroot image. Note that this file
.Em must
reside in the server directory being mounted. Next you will be asked for the
client's IP address, netmask, and default router, the server's IP address,
and the directory on the server to mount. Once you have entered this
information, SYS_INST will attempt to mount the NFS server and begin copying
the miniroot filesystem to the `b' partition of the target disk.
.Pp
Is is worth noting that this copy may take a while. It might be worth
grabbing a cup of coffee at this point.
.Pp
Once the miniroot filesystem image has been copied onto the target disk,
you may boot from the miniroot filesystem.
.Dl sys_inst\*> boot
Enter the disk from which to boot. The kernel in the miniroot filesystem
will be booted into single-user mode.
