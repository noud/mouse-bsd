.SH NAME
sysconfd - System configuration status message distributor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sysconfd
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sysconfd is part of an experimental and soon-to-be-deprecated
mechanism for distributing system status change messages.   It
is currently used only by the DHCP client.   Sysconfd acts as a
broadcast mechanism for status messages - a single sender can send
a message to sysconfd, and sysconfd will then send it to all subscribers.
In order to use statmsg, sysconfd must be running.
