A Kernel Programming Interface for Precision Time Signals
</h3><hr>

<p>The technical memorandum: <cite>A Kernel Programming Interface for
Precision Time Signals</cite><a
href="ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/people/mills/memos/memo96c.ps">
(PostScript) </a> describes a proposed programming interface for
external precision time signals, such as the pulse-per-second (PPS)
signal generated by some radio clocks and cesium oscillators.

<p>The memorandum argues for a generic capability in the ubiquitous Unix
kernel, which could be used for a wide variety of measurement
applications, including network time synchronization and experiments
involving performance measurement and evaluation of computer networks
and transmission systems. The hardware to do this requires only a serial
port and a modem control lead, such as the data carrier detect (DCD)
lead, which can be driven by an external source via a level
converter/pulse generator.
