<p><h4>Conformance Statement</h4>

<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time of a
computer client or server to another server or reference time source,
such as a radio or satellite receiver or modem. It provides accuracies
typically within a millisecond on LANs up to a few tens of milliseconds
on WANs relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), as provided by a
Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver, for example. Typical NTP
configurations utilize multiple redundant servers and diverse network
paths, in order to achieve high accuracy and reliability. Some
configurations include cryptographic authentication to prevent
accidental or malicious protocol attacks. Information on the NTP
architecture, protocol and algorithms can be found in the following
articles and reports, which are available online

<p>The NTP specification and implementation has evolved over the last
fifteen years to the current Version 3 of the protocol. This version
includes significant enhancements in accuracy and reliability, as
determined by experience in an estimated total of well over 100,000
clients and servers in the Internet, while retaining backward
compatibility with previous versions. The formal specification of the NTP
Version 3 protocol is contained in:

<p>This software distribution contains a fully compliant implementation
of the NTP Version 3 protocol, including an autonomous protocol daemon
that disciplines the local host clock, as well as a set of supporting
utility programs used to debug and manage one or more NTP servers in a
network. It includes complete sources and documentation for well over
two dozen Unix-based and Microsoft NT-based workstations and file
servers. The implementation is fully compliant with RFC-1305 and, in
addition, contains certain extensions compatible with, but not defined
by, that document. These extensions include:
