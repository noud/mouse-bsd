Arbiter 1088A/B GPS Receiver
</h3><hr>

<p><h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>Address: 127.127.11.<var>u</var>
<br>Reference ID: GPS
<br>Driver ID: GPS_ARBITER
<br>Serial Port: <code>/dev/gps<var>u</var></code>; 9600 baud, 8-bits,
no parity
<br>Features: <code>tty_clk</code>

<p><h4>Description</h4>

<p>This driver supports the Arbiter 1088A/B Satellite Controlled Clock.
The claimed accuracy of this clock is 100 ns relative to the PPS output
when receiving four or more satellites.

<p>The receiver should be configured before starting the NTP daemon, in
order to establish reliable position and operating conditions. It does
not initiate surveying or hold mode. For use with NTP, the daylight
savings time feature should be disables (<code>D0</code> command) and
the broadcast mode set to operate in UTC (<code>BU</code> command).

<p>The timecode format supported by this driver is selected by the poll
sequence <code>B5</code>, which initiates a line in the following format
to be repeated once per second until turned off by the <code>B0</code>
command.

<p>Format <code>B5</code> (24 ASCII printing characters):

<pre>
&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;i yy ddd hh:mm:ss.000bbb

on-time = &lt;cr&gt;
i = synchronization flag (' ' = locked, '?' = unlocked)
yy = year of century
ddd = day of year
hh:mm:ss = hours, minutes, seconds
.000 = fraction of second (not used)
bbb = tailing spaces for fill
</pre>

<p>The alarm condition is indicated by a '?' at i, which indicates the
receiver is not synchronized. In normal operation, a line consisting of
the timecode followed by the time quality character (TQ) followed by the
receiver status string (SR) is written to the clockstats file.

<p>The time quality character is encoded in IEEE P1344 standard:

<p>Format <code>TQ</code> (IEEE P1344 estimated worst-case time quality)

<pre>
0       clock locked, maximum accuracy
F       clock failure, time not reliable
4       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 1 us
5       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 10 us
6       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 100 us
7       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 1 ms
8       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 10 ms
9       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 100 ms
A       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 1 s
B       clock unlocked, accuracy &lt; 10 s
</pre>

<p>The status string is encoded as follows:

<p>Format <code>SR</code> (25 ASCII printing characters)

<pre>
V=vv S=ss T=t P=pdop E=ee

vv = satellites visible
ss = relative signal strength
t = satellites tracked
pdop = position dilution of precision (meters)
ee = hardware errors
</pre>

<p>A three-stage median filter is used to reduce jitter and provide a
dispersion measure. The driver makes no attempt to correct for the
intrinsic jitter of the radio itself.

<p><h4>Monitor Data</h4>

<p>The driver writes each timecode as received to the
<code>clockstats</code> file. When enabled by the <code>flag4</code>
fudge flag, an additional line containing the latitude, longitude,
elevation and optional deviation data is written to the
<code>clockstats</code> file. The deviation data operates with an
external pulse-per-second (PPS) input, such as a cesium oscillator or
another radio clock. The PPS input should be connected to the B event
channel and the radio initialized for deviation data on that channel.
The deviation data consists of the mean offset and standard deviation of
the external PPS signal relative the GPS signal, both in microseconds
over the last 16 seconds.

<p><h4>Fudge Factors</h4>

<dl>

<dt><code>time1 <i>time</i></code>
<dd>Specifies the time offset calibration factor, in seconds and
fraction, with default 0.0. For a calibrated Sun IPC, the correct value
is about .0065.

<p><dt><code>time2 <i>time</i></code>
<dd>Not used by this driver.

<p><dt><code>stratum <i>number</i></code>
<dd>Specifies the driver stratum, in decimal from 0 to 15, with default
0.

<p><dt><code>refid <i>string</i></code>
<dd>Specifies the driver reference identifier, an ASCII string from one
to four characters, with default <code>GPS</code>.

<p><dt><code>flag1 0 | 1</code>
<dd>Not used by this driver.

<p><dt><code>flag2 0 | 1</code>
<dd>Not used by this driver.

<p><dt><code>flag3 0 | 1</code>
<dd>Enable <code>ppsclock</code> line discipline/streams module if set.

<p><dt><code>flag4 0 | 1</code>
<dd>Enable extended <code>clockstats</code> recording if set.
