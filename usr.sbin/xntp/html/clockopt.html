Reference Clock Options

<p><h4>Reference Clock Support</h4>

<p>The NTP Version 3 daemon currently supports several different radio,
satellite and modem reference clocks plus a special pseudo-clock used
for backup or when no other clock source is available. Detailed
descriptions of individual device drivers and options can be found in
the <a href = "refclock.html"> Reference Clock Drivers </a> page.
Additional information can be found in the pages referenced there,
including the <a href="rdebug.html">Debugging Hints for Reference Clock
Drivers</a> and <a href="howto.html">How To Write a Reference Clock
Driver</a> pages. In many drivers, support for a PPS signal is available
as described in <a href="pps.html">Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal
Interfacing</a> page. Many drivers support special line
discipline/streams modules which can significantly improve the accuracy
using the driver. These are described in the <a href="ldisc.html">Line
Disciplines and Streams Drivers</a> page.

<p>A reference clock will generally (though not always) be a radio
timecode receiver which is synchronized to a source of standard time
such as the services offered by the NRC in Canada and NIST and USNO in
the U.S. The interface between the computer and the timecode receiver is
device dependent and will vary, but is often a serial port. A device
driver specific to each clock must be selected and compiled in the
distribution; however, most common radio, satellite and modem clocks
are included by default. Note that an attempt to configure a reference
clock when the driver has not been included or the hardware port has not
been appropriately configured results in a scalding remark to the system
log file, but is otherwise non hazardous.

<p>For the purposes of configuration, <code>xntpd</code> treats
reference clocks in a manner analogous to normal NTP peers as much as
possible. Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically correct but
invalid IP address, in order to distinguish them from normal NTP peers.
Reference clock addresses are of the form
<code>127.127.<i>t.u</i></code>, where <code><i>t</i></code> is an
integer denoting the clock type and <code><i>u</i></code> indicates the
type-specific unit number.

The <code>server</code> command is used to configure a reference clock,
where the <code><i>address</i></code> argument in that command is the
clock address. The <code>key</code>, <code>version</code> and
<code>ttl</code> options are not used for reference clock support. The
<code>mode</code> option is added for reference clock support, as
described below. The <code>prefer</code> option can be useful to
persuade the server to cherish a reference clock with somewhat more
enthusiasm than other reference clocks or peers. Further information on
this option can be found in the <a href = "prefer.html"> Mitigation
Rules and the <code>prefer</code> Keyword </a> page. The
<code>minpoll</code> and <code>maxpoll</code> options have meaning only
for selected clock drivers. See the individual clock driver document
pages for additional information.

<p>The stratum of a reference clock is by default zero. Since the
<code>xntpd</code> daemon adds one to the stratum of each peer, a
primary server ordinarily displays stratum one. In order to provide
engineered backups, it is often useful to specify the reference clock
stratum as greater than zero. The <code>stratum</code> option is used
for this purpose. Also, in cases involving both a reference clock and a
pulse-per-second (PPS) discipline signal, it is useful to specify the
reference clock identifier as other than the default, depending on the
driver. The <code>refid</code> option is used for this purpose. Except
where noted, these options apply to all clock drivers.

<p><h4>Reference Clock Commands</h4>

<dl>

<dt><code>server 127.127.<i>t.u</i> [ prefer ] [ mode <i>int</i> ]</code>
<dd>This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
ways. The options are interpreted as follows:

<dl>

<dt><code>prefer</code>
<dd>Marks the reference clock as preferred. All other things being
equal, this host will be chosen for synchronization among a set of
correctly operating hosts. See the <a href = "prefer.html"> Mitigation
Rules and the <code>prefer</code> Keyword </a> page for further
information.

<p><dt><code>mode <i>int</i></code>
<dd>Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in a device-specific
fashion. For instance, it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS driver
and a device subtype in the <code>parse</code> drivers.

<p><dt><code>minpoll <i>minpoll</i></code>
<dd>This option specifies the minimum polling interval for NTP messages,
in seconds to the power of two. The allowable range is 4 (16 s to 14
(16384 s) inclusive. The default is 6 (64 s) for all except modem
reference clocks, where the default is 10 (1024 s).

<p><dt><code>maxpoll <i>maxpoll</i></code>
<dd>This option specifies the maximum polling interval for NTP messages,
in seconds to the power of two. The allowable range is 4 (16 s to 14
(16384 s) inclusive. The default is 6 (64 s) for all except modem
reference clocks, where the default is 14 (16384 s).

</dl>

<dt><code>fudge 127.127.<i>t.u</i> [ time1 <i>secs</i> ] [ time2
<i>secs</i> ] [ stratum <i>int</i> ] [ refid <i>string</i> ] [ mode
<i>int</i> ] [ flag1 0 | 1 ] [ flag2 0 | 1 ] [ flag3 0 | 1] [ flag4 0 |
1 ]</code>
<dd>This command can be used to configure reference clocks in special
ways. It must immediately follow the <code>server</code> command which
configures the driver. Note that the same capability is possible at run
time using the <a href = "xntpdc.html"> <code>xntpdc</code></a> program.
The options are interpreted as follows:

<dl>

<dt><code>time1 <i>secs</i></code>
<dd>Specifies a constant to be added to the time offset produced by the
driver, a fixed-point decimal number in seconds. This is used as a
calibration constant to adjust the nominal time offset of a particular
clock to agree with an external standard, such as a precision PPS
signal. It also provides a way to correct a systematic error or bias due
to serial port latencies, different cable lengths or receiver internal
delay. The specified offset is in addition to the propagation delay
provided by other means, such as internal DIPswitches. Where a
calibration for an individual system and driver is available, an
approximate correction is noted in the driver documentation pages.

<p><dt><code>time2 <i>secs</i></code>
<dd>Specifies a fixed-point decimal number in seconds, which is
interpreted in a driver-dependent way. See the descriptions of specific
drivers in the <a href="refclock.html">reference clock drivers</a> page.

<p><dt><code>stratum <i>int</i></code>
<dd>Specifies the stratum number assigned to the driver, an integer
between 0 and 15. This number overrides the default stratum number
ordinarily assigned by the driver itself, usually zero.

<p><dt><code>refid <i>string</i></code>
<dd>Specifies an ASCII string of from one to four characters which
defines the reference identifier used by the driver. This string
overrides the default identifier ordinarily assigned by the driver
itself.

<p><dt><code>mode <i>int</i></code>
<dd>Specifies a mode number which is interpreted in a device-specific
fashion. For instance, it selects a dialing protocol in the ACTS driver
and a device subtype in the <code>parse</code> drivers.

<p><dt><code>flag1</code> <code>flag2</code> <code>flag3</code>
<code>flag4</code>
<dd>These four flags are used for customizing the clock driver. The
interpretation of these values, and whether they are used at all, is a
function of the particular clock driver. However, by convention, and
unless indicated otherwise, <code>flag3</code> is used to attach the
<code>ppsclock</code> streams module to the configured driver, while
<code>flag4</code> is used to enable recording verbose monitoring data
to the <code>clockstats</code> file configured with the
<code>filegen</code> command. Further information on the
<code>ppsclock</code> streams module can be found in the <a
href="pps.html">Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal Interfacing</a> page.
Further information on the <code>filegen</code> command can be found in
the <a href="monopt.html"> Monitoring Options </a> page.
