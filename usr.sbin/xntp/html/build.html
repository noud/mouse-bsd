Building and Installing the Distribution
</h3><hr>

<p>Following are instructions to build and install the programs in this
distribution.

<p>Note that the automatic build process inspects the machine
environment and tests for the presence of system header files and the
contents of these files to determine if certain features are available.
When one or more of these features are present, the code is compiled to
use them; if not, no special code is compiled. However, even if the code
is compiled to use these features, the code does a special test at run
time to see if one or more are actually present and avoids using them if
not present. In such cases a warning message is sent to the system log,
but the daemon should still work properly.

<p><h4>Building and Installing under Unix</h4>

<p>Make sure that you have all necessary tools for building executables.
These tools include <code>cc/gcc, make, awk, sed, tr, sh, grep,
egrep</code> and a few others. Not all of these tools exist in the
standard distribution of modern Unix versions (compilers are likely to
be an add-on product - consider using the <code>gnu</code> tools and
<code>gcc</code> compiler in this case). For a successful build, all of
these tools should be accessible via the current path.

<h5>Configuration</h5>

<p>Use the <code>configure</code> command to perform an automatic
configuration procedure. This procedure normally includes the debugging
code, which can be useful in diagnosing problems found in initial test,
and all reference clock drivers known to work with each machine and
operating system. Unless memory space is at a premium, this is a
sensible strategy and saves lots of messy fiddling. If you need to
delete either the debugging code or one or more or all reference clock
drivers to save space, see the <a href="config.html">Configuration
Options</a> page.

<p>If your site supports multiple architectures and uses NFS to share
files, you can use a single source tree to compile executables for all
architectures. While running on a target architecture machine and with
the distribution base directory active, create a subdirectory using a
command like <code>mkdir `config.guess`</code>, which will create an
architecture-specific directory with name peculiar to the architecture
and operating system. Then change to this directory and configure with
the <code>../configure</code> command. The remaining steps are the same
whether building in the base directory or in the subdirectory.

<h5>Compilation</h5>

<p>Use the <code>make</code> command to compile all source modules,
construct the libraries and link the distribution. Expect few or no
warnings using <code>cc</code> and a moderate level of warnings using
<code>gcc</code>. Note: On some Unix platforms the use of
<code>gcc</code> can result in quite a few complaints about system
header files and type inconsistencies, especially about pointer
variables. This is usually the case when the system header files are not
up to ANSI standards or <code>gcc</code>-isms. While the autoconfigure
process is quite thorough, the Unix programming cultures of the various
workstation makers still remain idiosyncratic.

<h5>Installation</h5>
<p>As root, use the <code>make install</code> command to install the
binaries in the destination directory. You must of course have write
permission on the install destination directory. This includes the
programs <a href="xntpd.html"><code>xntpd</code></a> (the daemon), <a
href="xntpdc.html"><code>xntpdc</code></a> (an <code>xntpd</code>-
dependent query program), <a href="ntpq.html"><code>ntpq</code></a> (a
standard query program), <a href="ntpdate.html"><code>ntpdate</code></a>
(an <code>rdate</code> replacement for boot time date setting and sloppy
time keeping) and <a href="ntptrace.html"><code>ntptrace</code></a> (a
utility useful to find the primary (stratum-1) servers). In some
systems, the <a href="tickadj.html"><code>tickadj</code></a> (a utility
useful to adjust kernel variables) is installed. If the precision time
kernel modifications are present, the <a
href="ntptime.html"><code>ntptime</code></a> (a utility useful to debug
kernel time functions) is installed.

<p>You are now ready to configure the daemon and start it. You will need
to create a NTP configuration file <code>ntp.conf</code> and possibly a
cryptographic key file <code>ntp.keys</code>. Directions for doing that
are in the <a href="notes.html">Notes on Configuring NTP and Setting up
a NTP Subnet</a>. A tutorial on debugging technique is in <a
href="debug.html">NTP Debugging Technique</a>. If problems peculiar to
the particular hardware and software environment are suspected, browse
the <a href="http:hints.html">Hints and Kinks</a> page.

<p>Bug reports of a general nature can be sent to David Mills
(mills@udel.edu). Bug reports of a specific nature on features
implemented by the programmer corps mentioned in the <a
href="copyright.html">Copyright</a> page should be sent directly to the
implementor listed in that page, with copy to mills@udel.edu.

<p><strong>Please include the version of the source distribution (e.g.,
xntp3-5.87) in your bug report.</strong>

<p><strong>Please include the output of <code>config.guess</code> in
your bug report.</strong>

<p><strong>It will look something like:
<code>pdp11-dec-fuzzos3.4</code></strong>

<p>Additional <code>make</code> commands

<dl>

<dt><code>make clean</code>
<dd>Cleans out object files, programs and temporary files.

<p><dt><code>make distclean</code>
<dd>Does the work of <code>clean</code>, but cleans out all directories
in preparation for a new distribution release.

<p><dt><code>make dist</code>
<dd>Does the work of <code>make distclean</code>, but constructs
compressed tar files for distribution. You must have GNU automake to
perform this function.

</dl>

<p><h4>Building and Installing under Windows NT</h4>

<p>Under Windows NT, you will need <code>Visual C++ 4.0</code> or above,
<code>InstallShield</code> SDK (comes with <code>VC++</code>),
<code>Perl5</code> and some version of the archiving program
<code>ZIP</code>.

<p>See the <code>./scripts/wininstall/readme.nt</code> file for
directions to compile the sources, build the libraries and link the
executables. Initiate the build by running either <code>bldrel.bat</code> 
or <code>blddbg.bat</code> to compile all of the source and create an 
<code>InstallShield</code> based graphical installation package.

<p>To install the executables, make sure that you are logged in as a
system account, or one with administrator privileges such as the
"administrator" account. As part of the build an
<code>InstallShield</code> based graphical installer was created. Run
<code>\xntp\scripts\wininstall\intel\disk1\setup.exe</code> to begin the
installation. This installer will prompt for basic defaults, copy the
binaries, install the service, and start it up.  The other option is
to run <code>\xntp\scripts\wininstall\distrib\install.bat</code> which
will do the basic installation from the command line.
