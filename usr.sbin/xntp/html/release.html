Release Notes
</h3><hr>

<p>The following changes are in the version 3-5.85 distribution relative
to the previous 3.5f version.

<ol>

<li>The automatic build procedure has been replaced with GNU
<code>autoconfigure</code>. This should make porting to nonstandard
machines and operating systems much easier and should simplify the
maintenance for multi-architecture sites. See the <code>./WHERE-TO-
START</code>, <code>./INSTALL</code> and <code>./README</code> files for
a brief overview of the new building and installing procedures. See the
the building and installing pages in the HTML documentation for further
information.

<p><li>A clock driver (type 11) is included for the Arbiter 1088A/B GPS
Receiver.

<p><li>The Windows NT build procedure is changed. See the
<code>./util/wininstall</code> directory for further information.

<p><li>A clock driver (type 11) is included for the Arbiter 1088A/B GPS
Receiver.

<p><li>The HTML documentation has been edited and updated to correct
outdated information and minor typographical errors. A new page has been
added for the Arbiter 1088A/B GPS Receiver.

<p><li>The <code>xntpd</code> daemon now calculates the authentication
delay automatically, so it no longer needs to be specified for each
architecture and operating system. The <code>-e</code> command-line
switch has been removed from the <code>xntpd</code> program. The
<code>authdelay</code> configuration option has been removed.

<p><li>The <code>auth</code>, <code>monitor</code>, <code>pll</code> and
<code>stats</code> flags are enabled by default. The
<code>bclient</code> and <code>pps</code> flags are disabled by default.
</ol>

<p>The following changes are in the version 3.5f distribution relative
to the previous 3.4y version.

<ol>

<li>Please note the scripts for configuring radio clock drivers do
not work. See the building and installing documentation for specific
information.

<p><li>The documentation has been completely reworked in HTML format
suitable for web browsing.

<p><li>The automatic build procedure has been improved to

<ul>

<li>support the line disciplines, streams modules and precision
time kernel modifications. These are controlled by the presence of
certain system-dependent header files in the
<code>/usr/include/sys</code> directory.
<li>include by default all reference clock drivers known to work
with each combination of hardware and operating system. (The particular
defaults are specified in the <code>../machines</code> files for each
machine.)

<li>activate precision time kernel modifications by default if
detected by the build procedure. (Previous versions required an
undocumented addition to the <code>ntp.drift</code> file in order to
activate these modifications.)

</ul>

<p><li>Three TrueTime reference clock drivers, which did slightly
different things with each model, have been replaced with one driver
(type 5) that works with all models. Two new reference clock drivers
have been added, one for the Bancomm IRIG interface, the other for the
TrueTime GPS-VME interface. Both of these work only with the HP
architecture.

<p><li>There is a new <code>pps</code> option to the <code>xntpdc</code>
program and configuration file <code>enable/disable</code> command,
which enables or disables the PPS precision time control signal for both
the PPS clock driver and kernel PPS interface, where available. This is
primarily intended for situations where external equipment has
malfunctioned or the signal has become excessively noisy.

<p><li>The <code>precision</code> configuration file command and
<code>xntpdc</code> command have been removed; the precision variable
quantity is now determined automatically and cannot be changed.

<p><li>The <code>authenticate</code> and <code>monitor</code> commands
in <code>xntpdc</code> have been removed; the functions formerly
provided by these commands are now provided by the <code>enable</code>
and <code>disable</code> commands.

<p><li>Fixed minor problems peculiar to different machines and system
environments. Fixed minor problem in the PPS interfaces and mitigation
rules. See the ./patches directory for details.

</ol>

<p>Version 3.5 has been compiled and run on at least the following
machines, operating systems and compilers. In all known cases, if the
gcc compiler eats it with some success, the cc compiler also enjoys the
meal; the converse is not always true. Note that, while all clock
drivers have been compiled, only certain ones have been tested with each
machine and operating system.

<p>Previous versions have been compiled and run on at least the
following machines, operating systems and compilers.
