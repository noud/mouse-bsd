Generic Reference Driver
</h3><hr>

<p><h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>Address: 127.127.8.<var>u</var>
<br>Reference ID: PARSE
<br>Driver ID: GENERIC
<br>Serial Port: <code>/dev/refclock-<var>u</var></code>; TTY mode according to clock type
<br>Features: <code>ppsclock</code>

<p><h4>Description</h4>

<p>The timecode of these receivers is sampled via a STREAMS module in
the kernel (The STREAMS module has been designed for use with SUN
Systems under SunOS 4.1.x or Solaris 2.3. It can be linked directly
into the kernel or loaded via the loadable driver mechanism). This
STREAMS module can be adapted to be able to convert different time
code formats. If the daemon is compiled without the STREAM
definition synchronization will work without the Sun streams module, 
though accuracy is significantly degraded. This feature allows to
use PARSE also on non Sun machines.

<p>The actual receiver status is mapped into various synchronization
states generally used by receivers. The STREAMS module is
configured to interpret the time codes of DCF U/A 31, PZF535,
GPS166, Trimble SV6 GPS, ELV DCF7000, Schmid and low cost receivers
(see list below).

<p>The reference clock support in xntp contains the necessary
configuration tables for those receivers. In addition to supporting
several different clock types and 4 devices, the generation a a
PPS signal is also provided as an configuration option. The PPS
configuration option uses the receiver generated time stamps for
feeding the PPS loopfilter control for much finer clock
synchronization.

<p>CAUTION: The PPS configuration option is different from the
hardware PPS signal, which is also supported (see below), as it
controls the way xntpd is synchronized to the reference clock,
while the hardware PPS signal controls the way time offsets are
determined.

<p>The use of the PPS option requires receivers with an accuracy of
better than 1ms.

<p>Fudge factors

<p>Only two fudge factors are utilized. The time1 fudge factor defines
the phase offset of the synchronization character to the actual
time. On the availability of PPS information the time2 fudge factor
defines the skew between the PPS time stamp and the receiver
timestamp of the PPS signal. This parameter is usually zero, as
usually the PPS signal is believed in time and OS delays should be
corrected in the machine specific section of the kernel driver.
time2 needs only be set when the actual PPS signal is delayed for
some reason. The flag1 enables input filtering. This a median
filter with continuous sampling. The flag2 selects averaging of the
samples remaining after the filtering. Leap second-handling is
controlled with the flag3. When set a leap second will be deleted
on receipt of a leap second indication from the receiver. Otherwise
the leap second will be added, (which is the default).
flag3 should never be set. PPS handling is enabled by adding 128 to
the mode parameter in the server/peer command.

<p>ntpq (8)

<p>timecode variable

<p>The ntpq program can read clock variables command list several
variables. These hold the following information: refclock_time is
the local time with the offset to UTC (format HHMM). The currently
active receiver flags are listed in refclock_status. Additional
feature flags of the receiver are optionally listed in parentheses.
The actual time code is listed in timecode. A qualification of the
decoded time code format is following in refclock_format. The last
piece of information is the overall running time and the
accumulated times for the clock event states in refclock_states.
When PPS information is present additional variable are available.
refclock_ppstime lists then the PPS timestamp and refclock_ppsskew
lists the difference between RS232 derived timestamp and the PPS
timestamp.

<p>Currently, fourteen clock types (devices /dev/refclock-0 -
/dev/refclock-3) are supported by the PARSE driver.

<p>Actual data formats and set-up requirements of the various clocks can
be found in <a href="http:parsedata.html">XNTP PARSE clock data formats</a>.
<p>The reference clock support carefully monitors the state
transitions of the receiver. All state changes and exceptional
events such as loss of time code transmission are logged via the
syslog facility. Every hour a summary of the accumulated times for
the clock states is listed via syslog.

<p>PPS support is only available when the receiver is completely
synchronized. The receiver is believed to deliver correct time for
an additional period of time after losing synchronizations, unless
a disruption in time code transmission is detected (possible power
loss). The trust period is dependent on the receiver oscillator and
thus a function of clock type. This is one of the parameters in the
clockinfo field of the reference clock implementation. This
parameter cannot be configured by xntpdc.

<p>In addition to the PPS loopfilter control a true PPS hardware
signal can be applied on Sun Sparc stations via the CPU serial
ports on the CD pin. This signal is automatically detected and will
be used for offset calculation. The input signal must be the time
mark for the following time code. (The edge sensitivity can be
selected - look into the appropriate kernel/parsestreams.c for
details). Meinberg receivers can be connected by feeding the PPS
pulse of the receiver via a 1488 level converter to Pin 8 (CD) of a
Sun serial zs-port.
To select PPS support the STREAMS driver for PARSE must be loaded and
the mode parameter ist the mode value of above plus 128. If 128 is
not added to the mode value PPS will be detected to be available but
it will not be used. For PPS to be used you MUST add 128 to the
mode parameter.

<p>There exists a special firmware release for the PZF535 Meinberg
receivers. This release (PZFUERL 4.6 (or higher - The UERL is
important)) is absolutely recommended for XNTP use, as it provides
LEAP warning, time code time zone information and alternate antenna
indication. Please check with Meinberg for this firmware release.
For the Meinberg GPS166 receiver is also a special firmware release
available (Uni-Erlangen). This release must be used for proper
operation.

<p>The raw DCF77 pulses can be fed via a level converter directly into
Pin 3 (Rx) of the Sun. The telegrams will be decoded an used for
synchronization. AM DCF77 receivers are running as low as $25. The
accuracy is dependent on the receiver and is somewhere between 2ms
(expensive) to 10ms (cheap). Upon bad signal reception of DCF77
synchronizations will cease as no backup oscillator is available as
usually found in other reference clock receivers. So it is
important to have a good place for the DCF77 antenna. For
transmitter shutdowns you are out of luck unless you have other NTP
servers with alternate time sources available.
