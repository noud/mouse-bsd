Undisciplined Local Clock
</h3><hr>

<p><h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>Address: 127.127.1.<var>u</var>
<br>Reference ID: LCL
<br>Driver ID: LOCAL

<p><h4>Description</h4>

<p>This is a hack to allow a machine to use its own system clock as a
reference clock, i.e., to free-run using no outside clock discipline
source. This is useful if NTP is to be used in an isolated environment
with no radio clock or NIST modem available. Pick a machine that has a
good clock oscillator (Digital machines are good, Sun machines are not)
and configure it with this driver. Set the clock using the best means
available, like eyeball-and-wristwatch. Then, point all the other
machines at this one or use broadcast (not multicast) mode to distribute
time.

<p>Another application for this driver is if a particular server clock
is to be used as the clock of last resort when all other normal
synchronization sources have gone away. This is especially useful if
that server has an ovenized oscillator. For this you would configure
this driver at a stratum greater than any other likely sources of time
(say 3 or 4) to prevent the server taking over when legitimate sources
are still available.

<p>A third application for this driver is when an external discipline
source is available, such as the NIST <code>lockclock</code> program,
which synchronizes the local clock via a telephone modem and the NIST
Automated Computer Time Service (ACTS), or the Digital Time
Synchronization Service (DTSS), which runs on DCE machines. In this case
the stratum should be set at zero, indicating a bona fide stratum-1
source. Exercise some caution with this, since there is no easy way to
telegraph via NTP that something might be wrong in the discipline source
itself. In the case of DTSS, the local clock can have a rather large
jitter, depending on the interval between corrections and the intrinsic
frequency error of the clock oscillator. In extreme cases, this can
cause clients to exceed the 128-ms slew window and drop off the NTP
subnet.

In the default mode the behavior of the clock selection algorithm is
modified when this driver is in use. The algorithm is designed so that
this driver will never be selected unless no other discipline source is
available. This can be overridden with the <code>prefer</code> keyword
of the <code>server</code> configuration command, in which case only
this driver will be selected for synchronization and all other
discipline sources will be ignored. This behavior is intended for use
when an external discipline source controls the system clock. See the <a
href = "prefer.html"> Mitigation Rules and the <code>prefer</code>
Keyword </a> page for a detailed description of the finicky behavior.

<p>The stratum for this driver is set at 3 by default, but can be
changed by the <code>fudge</code> configuration command and/or the
<code>xntpdc</code> utility. The reference ID is <code>LCL</code> by
default, but can be changed using the same mechanisms.
<strong>*NEVER*</strong> configure this driver to operate at a stratum
which might possibly disrupt a client with access to a bona fide primary
server, unless the local clock oscillator is reliably disciplined by
another source. <strong>*NEVER NEVER*</strong> configure a server which
might devolve to an undisciplined local clock to use multicast mode.
<p>This driver provides a mechanism to trim the local clock in both time
and frequency, as well as a way to manipulate the leap bits. The
<code>fudge time1</code> parameter adjusts the time (in seconds) and the
<code>fudge time2</code> parameter adjusts the frequency (in parts per
million). Both parameters are additive and operate only once; that is,
each command (as from <code>xntpdc</code>) adds signed increments in
time or frequency to the nominal local clock time and frequency. (Note:
The frequency cannot be changed when the kernel modifications are in use
- see the <a href="kern.html">A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping
</a> page.) The <code>fudge flag1</code> and <code>fudge flag2</code>
flags set the corresponding leap bits; for example, setting only
<code>flag1</code> causes a leap second to be inserted at the end of the
UTC day and setting only <code>flag2</code> causes a leap second to be
deleted at the end of the UTC day. Setting both flags causes the local
clock driver to appear unsynchronized, which may be a blessing if a
server violates the above rules, since <code>xntpdc</code> can turn the
bugger off. These bits are not reset automatically when the leap takes
place; they must be turned off manually after the leap event and before
the next UTC day.
