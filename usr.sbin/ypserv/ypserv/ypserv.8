.Sh NAME
.Nm ypserv
.Nd YP server daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ""
.Op Fl dl
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a fundamental part of the network information system called
.Tn YP .
This server provides information from
.Tn YP
maps to the
.Tn YP
clients on the network.
.Pp
A
.Tn YP
map is stored on the server as a
.Xr db 3
database.  A number of
.Tn YP
maps is grouped together in a domain.
.Nm
determines the domains it serves by looking for a directory with
the domain name in 
.Ar /var/yp .
.Pp
In an effort to improve the security of
.Tn YP
(which has, historically, not been very good), this
.Nm
has support for libwrap-based access control.  See
.Xr hosts_access 5
for more information.  The
.Em daemon
used for access control is the name which
.Nm
was invoked as (typically
.Dq ypserv
).  If a host is not allowed to query this
.Tn YP
server,
.Nm
will return the
.Tn YP
result code YP_NODOM.
.Pp
The process pid of the
.Nm
process can be found in the file
.Pa /var/run/ypserv.pid .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Use internet Domain Name System. If a query to map
.Pa hosts.byname
or
.Pa hosts.byaddr
fails, make a DNS query and return the result if successful.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
.It Fl l
Enable logging of all requests.
.El
.Pp
All messages are sent to the system log with the facility LOG_DAEMON.
Error messages have the priority LOG_ERR.  Refused requests are logged
with the priority LOG_WARNING.  All other messages are logged with the
priority LOG_INFO.

This implementation of
.Nm
was originally written by Mats O Jansson <moj@stacken.kth.se>.
The access control code was later re-written from scratch by
Jason R. Thorpe <thorpej@NetBSD.ORG>.
