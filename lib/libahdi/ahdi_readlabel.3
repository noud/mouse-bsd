.Dt ahdi_readlabel 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ahdi_readlabel
.Nd read AHDI partition label from disk
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libahdi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libahdi.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ahdi_readlabel "struct ahdi_ptable *ptable" "char *diskname" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function reads an AHDI partitioned disk and places the AHDI partition label
into
.Em ptable .
Partition letters are first assigned sequentially to partitions that have
the id `NBD' and then sequentially to other partitions.  Partition `b' will
only be assigned if a partition with the id `SWP' exists.  Partition `c' is
reserved for the whole disk.
.Pp
The function takes the following flags:
.Bl -column "AHDI_IGN_EXISTS" "Result" -offset indent
.It Em Flag Ta Em Result
.It Li FORCE_AHDI Ta
Read AHDI label even if NetBSD label exists
.It Li AHDI_IGN_EXISTS Ta
Ignore partition exists flag and assume all partitions are real
.It Li AHDI_IGN_EXT Ta
Ignore final extended partition pointer
.It Li AHDI_IGN_CKSUM Ta
Ignore mismatch between on-disk and calculated checksums
.It Li AHDI_IGN_SPU Ta
Ignore total sectors from root sector if different from that reported by the disk
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
function will try to open
.Em diskname ,
.Li then r Ns Em diskname Ns c,
.Li then /dev/r Ns Em diskname Ns c .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
function returns the following codes:
.Bl -column "Code" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Em Code Ta Em Meaning
.It Li  1 Ta
OK
.It Li -1 Ta
System call error (see value of errno)
.It Li -2 Ta
Device is not 512 bytes/sector
.It Li -3 Ta
No AHDI partitions found (or disk has valid NetBSD partitions)
.It Li -4 Ta
AHDI checksum error (on disk different from calculated)
.It Li -5 Ta
Bogus final extended partition (does not point to auxiliary root)
.It Li -6 Ta
AHDI total sectors does not match device total sectors

function does not recognise the (deprecated) partition ID's
.Em NBR ,
.Em NBU
or
.Em NBS .
