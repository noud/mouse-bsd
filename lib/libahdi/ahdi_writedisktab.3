.Dt ahdi_writedisktab 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm ahdi_writedisktab
.Nd write AHDI partition label in disktab form
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libahdi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libahdi.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ahdi_writedisktab "struct ahdi_ptable *ptable" "char *disktype" "char *disktab" "char *dtype"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function takes an AHDI label and writes it out in
.Xr disktab 5
format.  The
.Em disktype
parameter is the name given to the entry and can be passed as the
.Em disktype
to
.Xr disklabel 8 .
The
.Em disktab
parameter is the name of the disktab file to append the disktab to.  If this
parameter is empty, the default /etc/disktab is used.  The
.Em dtype
parameter, if not empty, is used as the `dt' paramter in the disktab.  It should
be one of the dktypenames defined in /usr/include/sys/disklabel.h.
.Pp
If an AHDI label has been written to the disk using the
.Fn ahdi_writedisktab 
function, the partition letters on the disk may not be consistent with those
in the ptable variable until a NetBSD dislabel
has been written with the
.Xr disklabel
command, using the disklabel generated by this function.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
function returns the following codes:
.Bl -column "Code" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Em Code Ta Em Meaning
.It Li  1 Ta
OK
.It Li -1 Ta
System call error (see value of errno)

.Sh HISTORY

package appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Julian Coleman, Waldi Ravens, Leo Weppelman
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
function does not recognise the (deprecated) partition ID's
.Em NBR ,
.Em NBU
or
.Em NBS .
.Pp
If no partition of type
.Em NBD
or
.Em RAW
exist, no NetBSD disklabel can be written to the disk.
