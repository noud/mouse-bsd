.Sh NAME
.Nm ahdi_writelabel
.Nd write AHDI partition label to disk
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libahdi
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libahdi.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ahdi_writelabel "struct ahdi_ptable *ptable" "char *diskname" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function writes an AHDI format disk from an AHDI label.  The root sector
that is written contains no boot code and the bad sector list contains no
entries.  Any existing NetBSD disklabel for this disk will be invalidated.
.Nm
calls
.Xr ahdi_checklabel
and will not write the information if 
.Xr ahdi_checklabel
returns an error.
.Pp
The function takes the following flags:
.Bl -column "AHDI_IGN_EXISTS" "Result" -offset indent
.It Em Flag Ta Em Result
.It Li AHDI_KEEP_BOOT Ta
Keep the existing boot code in the root sector
.It Li AHDI_KEEP_BSL Ta
Keep the existing bad sector list
.It Li AHDI_KEEP_NBDA Ta
Keep the existing NetBSD disk label
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
function will try to open
.Em diskname ,
.Li then r Ns Em diskname Ns c,
.Li then /dev/r Ns Em diskname Ns c .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
function returns the following codes:
.Bl -column "Code" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Em Code Ta Em Meaning
.It Li  1 Ta
OK
.It Li -1 Ta
System call error (see value of errno)
.It Li <-1 Ta
.Xr ahdi_checklabel
returned an error

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
function does not recognise the (deprecated) partition ID's
.Em NBR ,
.Em NBU
or
.Em NBS .
.Pp
If no partition of type
.Em NBD
or
.Em RAW
exist, no NetBSD disklabel can be written to the disk.
