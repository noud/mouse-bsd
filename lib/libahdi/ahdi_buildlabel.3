.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <libahdi.h>
.Ft int
.Fn ahdi_buildlabel "struct ahdi_ptable *ptable"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function builds a label suitable for use on AHDI partitioned disk.  If the
total number of partitions is greater than four, it will make the first
three partitions primary partitions and the others extended partitions.
If the total number of partitions is four or less, the function will make
all the partitions primary partitions.
.Pp
If passed a partition table containing primary and/or extended partitions,
these will be modified, if necessary, to conform to the above specifications.
If there are no primary or extended partitions in the partition table, they
will be created.  In both cases, the start sector of partitions may be
modified in order to leave space for any auxiliary root sectors.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
function returns the following codes:
.Bl -column "Code" "Meaning" -offset indent
.It Em Code Ta Em Meaning
