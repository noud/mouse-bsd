This is a gitification of my patches to NetBSD 1.4T.

It is a work in progress.  Until this file disappears (or is updated to
say otherwise), this tree is liable to be reworked in relatively
drastic ways, such as rewinding and replaying large numbers of commits
or other things not generally good practice for published git repos.
Of course, like all my stuff, any use of it is strictly at your own
risk, but in this case I am not taking anyone else's concerns into
account at all until I've got a git repo I'm happy with with all my
1.4T patches (or at least all the ones I decide to keep - I've already
found a few I have decided to discard).  Tracking it is perhaps
appropriate for the curious, but is unlikely to be appropriate for
anyone else.

Until, that is, this file disappears or states otherwise, as I said
above.
