This is a gitification of my patches to NetBSD 1.4T.  I have now
gitified all my changes which I want to keep.

It still is in a sense a work in progress, like any live repo, but the
note which used to be here that it is liable to be rewound on a whim no
longer applies.  I've now done full builds of the world on at least two
arches (sparc and i386) and things seem to be behaving, so I see no
reason to think that anything further can't be dealt with via normal
changes rather than going back and rewinding a bunch of stuff.
