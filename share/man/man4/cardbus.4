.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support and
drivers for Cardbus devices.
.Pp
The flags are used with cardslot definition.  The lowest order bit
(rightmost bit) of the flags define the pccard attach sequence at the
boot time.  When the bit is set, a pccard on the slot is probed and
attached immidiately.  On the other hand, the pccard is probed after
kernel thread wakes up.  If a pccard is used as a boot device (ex. CF
card or network card), you should set the bit 1.
.Sh SUPPORTED DEVICES
