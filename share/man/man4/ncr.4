.Sh NAME
.Nm ncr
.Nd NCR 53C8xx SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ncr* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at ncr?"
.Pp
.Cd "options FAILSAFE"
.Cd "options NCR_CDROM_ASYNC"
.Cd "options NCR_IOMAPPED"
.Cd "options NCR_TEKRAM_EEPROM"
.Cd "options SCSI_NCR_DFLT_TAGS=integer"
.Cd "options SCSI_NCR_MAX_SYNC=integer"
.Cd "options SCSI_NCR_MAX_WIDE=integer"
.Cd "options SCSI_NCR_SYMBIOS_COMPAT"
.Cd "options SCSI_NCR_TRUST_BIOS"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the NCR (Symbios) 53C810, 53C815, 53C820,
53C825, 53C860, 53C875, 53C885, 53C895, and 53C896
.Tn SCSI
controller chips.
.Pp
The following kernel configuration options are available:
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd options FAILSAFE
Disables tagged command queuing and forces asynchronous transfers for
.Tn CD-ROM
devices.
.It Cd options NCR_CDROM_ASYNC
Always use asynchronous transfers with
.Tn CD-ROM
devices.
By default, synchronous transfers are used if the
.Tn CD-ROM
supports it.
.It Cd options NCR_IOMAPPED
Attempt to access the controller chip via I/O port-mapped I/O, falling back
to memory-mapped I/O if the I/O ports couldn't be mapped.
By default, memory-mapped I/O is tried first.
.It Cd options NCR_TEKRAM_EEPROM
Enables support for reading the configuration
.Tn EEPROM
of the Tekram DC-390 series of
.Tn SCSI
cards.
Enable this only if using a Tekram DC-390 card.
.It Cd options SCSI_NCR_DFLT_TAGS=integer
Specifies the maximum number of tags per logical unit.
Unless
.Dv FAILSAFE
is defined, the default value is 4.
A value of 0 will disable tagged command queuing.
.It Cd options SCSI_NCR_MAX_SYNC=integer
Specifies the maximum synchronous transfer frequency to use, in kHz.
A value of 0 means asynchronous transfers only.
The default is 20000 (20MHz), unless the controller chip only
supports fast transfers, in which case it's 10000 (10MHz).
.It Cd options SCSI_NCR_MAX_WIDE=integer
Specifies the maximum
.Tn SCSI
bus width, with 0 meaning 8 bits and 1 meaning 16 bits.
Defaults to 1 on chips that support wide
.Tn SCSI ,
0 otherwise.
Set this to 0 to disable wide transfers even if both controller
and device support them (e.g. when using a wide controller and wide
drive through a narrow cable).
.It Cd options SCSI_NCR_SYMBIOS_COMPAT
Enables the use of the GPIO register as a disk activity indicator.
Enable this if the activity LED isn't working, but make sure the
card doesn't use GPIO for something else.
Cards known to support this:
ASUS SC875, Diamond FirePort 40, and Symbios SYM8751S.
.It Cd options SCSI_NCR_TRUST_BIOS
Specifies that the driver should use the register configuration set by the
firmware instead of configuring the chip itself.
