.Ft void
.Fn panic "const char *fmt, ..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

for later retrival via core dump inspection.

If a kernel debugger is installed, control is passed to it after the
message is printed.
Otherwise an attempt is made to save an image of system memory on the
dump device that was configured at the time the kernel was compiled.
.Pp
If during the process of handling the panic,
.Fn panic
is called again
.Pq "from the filesystem synchronization routines, for example" ,
the system is rebooted immediately without synchronizing any filesystems.
.Sh RETURN VALUES

function does not return.
