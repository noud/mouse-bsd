.Dt REBOOT 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm reboot ,
.Nm halt
.Nd
stopping and restarting the system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm halt
.Op Fl dlnpq
.Nm ""
.Op Fl dlnq
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm halt
and
.Nm
utilities flush the file system cache to disk, send all running processes
a SIGTERM, wait up to 30 seconds for them to die, send a SIGKILL to the
survivors and, respectively, halt or restart the system.
The action is logged, including entering a shutdown record into the login
accounting file and sending a message via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Create a dump before halting or restarting.
This option is useful for debugging system dump procedures or
capturing the state of a corrupted or misbehaving system.
.It Fl l
Suppress sending a message via
.Xr syslog 3
before halting or restarting.
.It Fl n
Do not flush the file system cache.
This option should be used with extreme caution.
.It Fl p
Attempt to powerdown the system.  If the powerdown fails, or the system
does not support software powerdown, the system will halt.  This option
is only valid for
.Nm halt .
.It Fl q
Do not give processes a chance to shut down before halting or restarting.
This option should not normally be used.
.El
.Pp
Normally, the
.Xr shutdown 8
utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
users advance warning of their impending doom.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr utmp 5 ,
.Xr boot 8 ,
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
.Xr sync 8
.Sh BUGS
The single user shell will ignore the SIGTERM signal.
To avoid waiting for the timeout when 
rebooting or halting from the single user shell, you have to
.Ic exec reboot
or
.Ic exec halt .
