If you get many errors like below:

  ioconf.c:102: `NEC_MCR' undeclared here (not in a function)
  ioconf.c:102: initializer element for `loc[12]' is not constant

The file ioconf.incl.hpcmis in this directry is not correctly included into
ioconf.c. You must upgrade config(8) so that mkioconf.c of rev. 1.52 or higher
is used, or run config as following steps:

1) Make target directry by hand if it dose not exist.

  ex:
   # mkdir ../compile/GENERIC

2) Copy ioconf.incl.hpcmips into target directory.

  ex:
   # cp ./ioconf.incl.hpcmips ../compile/GENERIC

3) Run config command normaly.

  ex:
   # /usr/sbin/config GENERIC

If you get same errors, check ioconf.c in target directory and ensure that
ioconf.incl.hpcmips is embedded in the head of ioconf.c.

See also the config utility source code, usr.sbin/config/mkioconf.c.
