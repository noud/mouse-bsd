#	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.9 1999/01/01 12:13:49 mark Exp $

Ok this is the current todo list.

There are a number of things that need to be done that I do not
have time to do and am unlikely to have time to do them in the near
future. These are currently being left in the hope that users will do them
instead and are marked with *.

o  replace netns/ns_chsum.c with an assembly version (*)
o  drivers for currently unsupported podules (*)
o  replacing the C string functions in libc with assembly ones (work
   started but not finished) (*)
o  L1 page tables should be freed when a process is swapped out and
   reallocated when the process is swapped in.
o  debug / replace console code. UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  optimise irq delivery code UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  improve fiq handling code
o  Complete hydra support
o  Remove stubs.c
o  Remove postmortem.c
o  Debug audio drivers
o  16 bit sound driver.
o  Create generic SEEQ8004/8005 driver. (TESTING DRIVER)
o  Create ea and eb front ends for the generic SEEQ driver. (TESTING DRIVER)
o  Merge in Ether2 driver
o  Reorganise kernel VM space UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  Implement DMA transfers to buffer memory for the asc driver.
o  Add interrupt and DMA support to the cosc driver
o  Optimise Strong ARM support UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  Debug multiple mappings in pmap.c UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  Optimise data xfers for the ea and eb drivers (TESTING DRIVER)
o  Update drivers to use new bus space macros UNDER DEVELOPMENT
o  Debug serial consoles.
o  Implement bus space DMA support for IOMD.
o  the podule attach args should pass the interrupt number for
   podule or network slot so that the podulebus is the only
   driver that needs to know about the irq numbers.
o  A mechanism for obtaining the MAC address for netslot cards
   is needed instead of drivers building it from the bootconfig
   machine ID on the RiscPC.
o  Implement interrupts on the Connect32 driver.
o  Debug IOMD DMA handling.
o  Implement driver for etherlan500 podule.
o  Implement generic soft interrupts. (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
o  Improve interaction of VIDC and IOMD.
o  Cleanup passing of boot information.
o  Cleanup description of available memory regions
o  Replace sfas driver with MI NCR53C9X driver.
o  Support runtime selection of IRQ subsystem.
o  Support runtime selection of FPE.
o  vm_offset_t -> [pv]addr_t (PENDING EBSA285 COMMIT)
o  Delayed cache / TLB clean/flushing
o  Tracking dirty state of USR addresses in cache
o  Close all outstanding PRs
o  merge SA1100 support
