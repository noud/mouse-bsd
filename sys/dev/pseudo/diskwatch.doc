diskwatch pseudo-device driver.

A diskwatch device is associated with a disk device.  Conceptually,
this is just a means whereby as the disk is read from and/or written
to, a userland process hears about it.

There are four modes available:

0 - The kernel does not report reads/writes to userland at all.
1 - The kernel reports the numbers of sectors written.
2 - The kernel reports writes as sector number and data.
3 - The kernel reports the numbers of sectors read or written.

In mode 2, provided writes occur at a low enough rate for userland to
keep up, writes are simply copied to userland, each tagged with the
block number of the block written to.  When writers overrun the reader,
the kernel falls back to mode 1, passing just the block numbers.  If
userland fails to keep up with even this reduced data rate, the kernel
falls back to mode 0.  Each such slowdown is reported to userland; the
kernel does not resume sending at the higher data rate until userland
tells it to.

Mode 3 is like mode 1 in that the kernel will fall back to mode 0 if it
overruns userland.  There is no mode that reports reads with data read
(that is, there is nothing that is to mode 3 what mode 2 is to mode 1).

Userland's interface is through a character special device.  There are
two of these for each diskwatch device, a `control' device and a `data'
device.  The `control' device is used for tasks such as telling the
diskwatch device what real disk device to watch; the `data' device is
the interface through which disk blocks are passed from the kernel to
userland.

Writes to the control device are expected to be plain text commands.
The first character is a command code.  The recognized commands, and
the rest of the write in each case, are:

	d
		Set the real disk device.  The rest of the string is f
		followed by a number (in decimal, as text), which must
		be the number of a file descriptor open on the relevant
		raw disk device in the writing process.  (The f is to
		allow easy extensibility to other possible ways of
		identifying the disk.)

	3
		Switch to mode 3 (report read and write block numbers).
		No additional data.

	2
		Switch to mode 2 (writes only, block numbers and
		contents).  No additional data.

	1
		Switch to mode 1 (writes only, just block numbers).  No
		additional data.

	0
		Switch to mode 0: stop sending altogether.  No
		additional data.

If the write does not fit the above, the write returns showing EIO.
Note that a command cannot be split between two writes, nor can
multiple commands be combined into a single write.  Note that setting a
non-stopped data rate may have no visible effect, throttling back
immediately, if the queue is already too full.

Reads from the control device return a 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicating the
current sending data rate.

Note that 0, 1, etc above are the ASCII characters, that is, they are
octet values 0x30, 0x31, etc, not octets 0x00, 0x01, etc.

The data device rejects all write attempts (EIO).  Each read from it
returns zero or more data packets, concatenated in the buffer space
provided.  If the first data packet is too large for the buffer, the
read returns showing EMSGSIZE without changing anything.  A read will
never return a partial data packet; if the space remaining at the end
of the buffer after dequeueing some data packets is less than the size
of the next packet, the packet is left alone and the read returns a
less than completely filled buffer.

Data packets consist of an unsigned long long int, possibly followed by
more data.  The high 8 bits of (the low 64 bits of) this value indicate
what the packet is:

	0x00
		The packet is a full write data block.  The low 56 bits
		contain the block number; the following 512 bytes
		contain the new block data.

	0x01
		The packet is a write data block number.  The low 56
		bits contain the block number; there is nothing
		following.

	0x02
		The packet indicates that the kernel has stopped
		sending entirely.

	0x03
		The packet is a read data block number.  The low 56
		bits contain the block number; there is nothing
		following.

Note in particular that if the read buffer is aligned to a natural
unsigned long long int boundary, every packet beginning will be too.

A diskwatch device is said to be "ready" whenever both its control
device and its data device are open.  Whenever a diskwatch device
becomes non-ready, it disassociates itself from any disk device it may
be associated with, discards anything it has buffered, and returns EIO
from any I/O attempts that may be done on any descriptor that may be
open.  When a diskwatch device is ready but has not yet had any disk
device associated with it, attempts to do anything but set its disk
device (including read from the data device) return showing EIO.
Whenever a diskwatch device's disk device is set or changed, it reverts
to "not sending anything" mode, as if a "0" command had been given.
Attempts to set the disk device to a device that does not support
diskwatching return EOPNOTSUPP.

For diskwatch device N, the control device is minor 4*N and the data
device is minor (4*N)+1.  Minors (4*N)+2 and (4*N)+3 are reserved for
future use.
